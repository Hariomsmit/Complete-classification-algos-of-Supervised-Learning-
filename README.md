# Complete-classification-algos-of-Supervised-Learning-
In this Project we can predict the required report or result based on data frame which has record of past happenings . It contains all the algorithms of classification in supervised learning , we just need to uncomment-out the one we want to use for data training and we have to keep the rest imported algorithms commented.
If you want to use Logistic Regression then you will do as follows:

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
#from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
#from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
#from sklearn.svm import SVC
#from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
#from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

and change the "Model" to whatever algorithm you want to implement.
